console.log("Hey Hello How are you");

var a = 30;

console.log(a);


a = "hello";    //Re-assignment 


var a= "bye";   //Re-Declartion


console.log(a);


// Problems of Var keyword
// The var keyword allows the re-declaration of variables.



// let r = 10;

// r = 30;

// console.log(r);

// let r = 100;

// let y="a";


// console.log(r);



// const x =5;

// x=10;

// console.log(x);

// const x=10;

// console.log(x);


// Dynamically Types : 
//  In dynamically typed languages, the type of a variable is determined at runtime. This means that you don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly, and the same variable can hold values of different types at different times
JS


//Statically Typed : 
// In statically typed languages, the type of a variable is determined at compile-time, before the code is run. This means that you must declare the type of each variable explicitly, and the compiler checks type correctness before the program executes.

JAVA C++

// int x=5;
// x="hello";
